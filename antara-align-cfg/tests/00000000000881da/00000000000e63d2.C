    printf("Hi! google.I wish to share something heart touching happened to me when i was just about to start google code jam.My group squad so called friends.I asked one of them when is code jam gonna be start.He told tomorrow morning which is actually the finishing time not the starting time.He was our squad coder,geek,programmer,who doesn't have skills but everytime shows his arrogance nature.Now, i was thinking somwthing is wrong because best of my knowledge i knew google has begun i though in my mind.I confirmed to my another college friend.He told me that it has begun already and about to end,i was so disheartening but somhow i managed myself and open my lappy and yes,it had begun i logged in and go through the problem statements.But, as everyone knows i'm not that much good in coding.But still i'm trying to solve the problems.Giving my best , still unable to crack.I appreciate your questions and your code jam.Since, i was idle so i thought why shouldn't i utilize my time and now i'm typing this.The thing which i realized today is that people ask only for their own benefit no one is there who cares for yourself, you are the only one who cares for yourself.To be honest i'm having so much anger but however, i asked him again whether code jam had begun or not he said no, and i told him bro it had begun ,my friend had just informed me, and our coder ,the geek reaction was like ya ok we'll see tomorrow, i'm seriously.This is how i realized that people are so selfish and i recognized something which i'll never forget THANK YOU GOOGLE I LEARNED SOMETHING BECAUSE FOR YOU.");
